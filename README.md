# Puppet language syntax highlighting for Emacs

This is my fork of the official puppet-syntax-emacs repository by Puppet Labs.

I merged additional commits by other people and also added a couple of things myself. I used this major mode for my daily editing of Puppet code.

In the meanwhile I switched to the Puppet mode maintained by Voxpupuli:  https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-mode

This branch is just an archive of my old work.
